# 🛡️ VAPT Network Report – Metasploitable 2  

## 📌 About This Project  
This repository contains a **Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) Report** conducted on a simulated **Metasploitable 2** network. The objective of this project is to **showcase penetration testing skills**, perform **real-world security assessments**, and provide **detailed mitigation strategies** to secure enterprise environments.  

---

## 📖 Scenario  
Imagine this **Metasploitable 2** machine as part of a company's internal network infrastructure. The organization suspects that its **legacy systems** might have security flaws that could be exploited by **external attackers** or **insider threats**.  

As a **security consultant**, I conducted a **full-scale penetration test** to:  
- Identify potential security gaps.  
- Simulate **real-world cyberattacks** using ethical hacking techniques.  
- Provide a **detailed report** to help the organization **secure its infrastructure**.  

---

## 🎯 Objective  
The primary goals of this assessment were to:  
✔️ **Discover and analyze vulnerabilities** in the target network.  
✔️ **Demonstrate real-world exploitation** of discovered weaknesses.  
✔️ **Provide actionable security recommendations** to improve overall security posture.  
✔️ **Generate a professional VAPT report** following industry standards.

## 🛠️ Methodology & Tools Used  
This penetration test followed the **standard VAPT methodology**, divided into multiple phases:  

### **1️⃣ Reconnaissance & Information Gathering**  
- Used **Nmap** to scan the network and identify open ports.  
- Mapped out services and operating system details.  

### **2️⃣ Scanning & Enumeration**  
- Performed **banner grabbing** to gather additional service details.  
- Used **SearchSploit** and vulnerability databases to identify known CVEs.  

### **3️⃣ Exploitation & Vulnerability Analysis**  
- Used **Metasploit** to exploit vulnerabilities and gain access.  
- Simulated potential attack vectors, including **privilege escalation**.  

### **4️⃣ Post-Exploitation & Risk Assessment**  
- Identified **critical misconfigurations** and **high-risk exploits**.  
- Documented security flaws with **proof-of-concept (PoC) attacks**.  

### **5️⃣ Mitigation & Reporting**  
- Provided **detailed remediation steps** for each vulnerability.  
- Generated **HTML/PDF reports** with severity ratings and risk assessments.
